# A Typescript 3.x NPM Module

I may or may not work on this, but if you'd like to work with me on it then let me know in the Issues

Simple starter library from June 2017.
Tutorial can be found at
[how-to-write-a-typescript-library.com](http://how-to-write-a-typescript-library.com).

Or just browse the code here! Or clone the repo.

# Usage

```javascript
/* Coming Soon */
```

then modify whatever you want, then

```
tsc
```

You can check if everything is working like this:

And once you're ready, simply change the `name` in the `package.json`
and publish your brand new cool library. Have fun!
